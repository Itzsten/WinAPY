# WinAPY
Windows API wrapper for Python written in C.

## Features
Currently, 135 Windows functions and macros are supported, and there will be more futuristically.

WinAPY features high-level and rich communications with the Windows API, bringing a low-level mess down to a single function. Although it may currently have a few plenties of integrations, this project aims at wrapping as many integrations as possible to Python and will feature more.
